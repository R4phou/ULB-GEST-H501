## 1. Introduction warehousing and distribution logistics
#Distribution #Deliver is a super important **function** in the logistics operations ecosystem.

It is the **interface** producer-customer and it's **quality is critical** since it *shapes the first customer's impression* (which should be positive).

It often requires a **physical distribution network** or a #warehouse (upstream or downstream) and/or an additional processing.
$\to$ With #warehouse, a good *inventory management system is critical*.
## 2. Role of warehouses and types of warehouses
The use of #warehouse in a distributiuon system can be justified by the need to:
- Cope with any **variability** of climate, market, prices, etc
- Ensure delivery at the right time (shortening customer lead times)
- Group products from different producers/suppliers
- Save space in the manufacturing plant
- Increase quality of services

Warehouses **can belong to the company OR to a third party**.

It's **role** is to **store** items used to support production (raw materials) or finished goods to be delivered.

The **functions** of #warehouse:

There are **4** different **types** of #warehouse:
- For production
- For storing goods before delivery![](Pasted%20image%2020241119153854.png)![](Pasted%20image%2020241119154123.png)

## 3. The platform: a particular type of warehouse
A #platform is a type of #warehouse that is an **intermediate physical entity in the distribution process which allows unloading, repackaging and shipping of goods** in which there is **NO STORAGE** at all.

There are no intended
#todo 

## 4. Cross-docking - a particular function
#Cross-docking's principle:
- Reception at the #platform of pallets from multiple suppliers
- Fragmentation of pallets, sorting and repackaging (each package may contain products from multiple suppliers)
- Shipping packages to customers

The **benefits**:
- Reduction of inventory costs in the central warehouse
- Increased Gross Labeled
- #todo sl43
$\implies$ Average **gain of +- 20% of the storage time** of a product

Here we have two examples:

## 5. Warehouse management
![](Pasted%20image%2020241119155703.png)

The **when to order** question depends on the **order point** that depends on the *safety stock*, *lead times*, *average demands* and *acceptable threshold of stockouts*.![](Pasted%20image%2020241119155902.png)

But then **what quantity** to order depends on *calculation of economic quantity order* #EOQ. It is the optimal order quantity considering the inventory cost and ordering cost.![](Pasted%20image%2020241119160104.png)

## 6. Distribution network
The #distribution-network **ensures at the lowest cost and a high level of service delivery**.

A **successful achievenement** of the above depends on:
- Number of location of customers to be served
- Type of distribution networks
- Number of location
- #todo sl55
## 7. Structure of distribution network
The **basic structures of a distribution network**:
1. Direct delivery (without transfer): #source $\to$ #customer
2. One-level structure: #source $\to$ #warehouse $\to$ #customer 
	- A central #warehouse brings that it is close to the customers and possible to consolidate *BUT* the number of transfers and breaking of loads increases
	- A *network of local stores*: faster delivery *BUT* inventory levels are hard to see and difficulty to conbsolidate
	![](Pasted%20image%2020241119162237.png)
3. **Two-level distribution center**
	- A **Central warehouse with a network of regional stores**: Plants supply warehouse #todo sl57
	- A **Central warehouse with a network of platforms**: orders are prepared in the central warehouse then disaggregated in and distributed from the platforms![](Pasted%20image%2020241119162534.png)
## 8. Optimisation of a distribution network
Now we can try to find how many warehouses we need to have in our distribution network.

For that we do an *economic optimization of a distribution network* and we can see that it depends on the number, size and location of the warehouses, stores, platforms and needs of inventory/shipment.

## 9. Transport
The #transport is the **connection between the levels** and between the **components of the** #distribution-network.

It's #quality is a **key component** of overall service quality.

There are various ways of transport modes:
- Rail, road, waterways, air
- #Multimodal using different transportation modes and can break the load into different loads
- #Intermodal no breaks, **same** container that will be on different modes of transport for one trajectory.
- #Question Difference between #Multimodal and #Intermodal: Load is broken or not.

Concerning the **costs repartition**:![](Pasted%20image%2020241119163635.png)

The **critical issues**:
- **Increasing environmental concerns** (CO2 reduction)
- Globalisation, international transport
- Need for transport
- Transport costs (fixed, variable, overheads)
- Choice of transport mode
- Route optimization
- Autonomous/automated transport
- Safety and security
- **Greening of transport activities** (absolute necessity)
## 10. Conclusion
As the primary role of the #warehouse is to store items used to support production (raw, materials, etc.) or finished goods to be delivered, the critical **challenge is to reduce inventory costs**.

A particular trend is to introduce within the warehouses, cost efficient activities/actions that add value to the products therein stored.
