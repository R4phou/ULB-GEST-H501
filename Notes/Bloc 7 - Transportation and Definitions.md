# Definition
Transport systems convey goods from the source to the exits and sinks of a logistics/production network.

Size:
- Between 1/3 and 2/3 of total logistics costs.
- Between 9/10% of gross national product for the Europe economy
- 10 to 20% of the product's prize
- The **most important logistics cost**

The roles:
- Firms and their products' market are often separated geographically
- Increases the **place** utility of the products
- Increasing the customer's level satisfaction
- Moving any shipment is a #logistic-system

#Transportation aims to:
- bridge the geographical gap
- The growth of competition
- Economies of scale
- Lower the selling price

The **performance characteristics** for transportation is driven by 5 factors:
- #cost:
	- The rate paid to the carrier for use of the mode itself
	- Load and unload, occurrence of spoilage and damage, insurance to protect against possible loss
- #Frequency of the transport
- #completeness to the ability of the transport mode to move inventory from one location to another without the use of other modes
	- The *less material* is handled between the point of origin and the point of destination, the *lower the transport cost/the shorter the delivery time*
- #capability: the ability of a given transport #todo
- #dependability: how **reliable** is this transportation mode to deliver 
	- Poor dependability adds cost in the form of excess inventories etc
$\implies$ The #speed is the *time required to load products onto the transport vehicle at the shipping terminal, traverse distance and intermediate terminal points, and deliver the products to the receiving terminal*.
- The ability to transport products from one point to another as quickly as possible is the **most fundamental performance characteristic** of #Transportation.
- Utilities of time and place

The influencing factors:
- **Required delivery lead time**
- Financial capabilities
- Product characteristics
- Order quantity size
- Supply chain strategic goals
- Geographical size of the channel network
- Carrier-type availability
- Strength of the competition
## Modes of transportation
### Air
Planes have three cost components:
- Cost of labor and fuel
- A fixed cost: infrastructure and equipment
- A variable cost: depends on the passenger/carriers

Plus/negative:
- **Fast**/expensive
- **Small**/High value items or time sensitive emergency shipments
- Shipments under 500 pounds
- High-value but lightweight high-tech products (e.g. chips for processors etc).

The key issues that air carriers face includes:
- Identifying the location/number of hubs
- Assigning plane routes
- Setting up maintenance etc
- #todo
### Package carriers
A good option for small packages (letters to <150 pounds packages)

It is nice as it is **rapid and reliable delivery**.

But it also has other services:
- Tracking of the packages, processing and assembly of products
- For small and time-sensitive shipments
$\implies$ Used for #amazon, #GIlt etc

### Truck
In 2002, 70% of US commercial freight by value and 60% by weigh were shipped by #truck.
- #TL = Truckload
- #LTL = Less than truckload

Trucking is more expensive than rail **but offers door-to-door shipment** with **shorter delivery time**.
### Rail
**Cheapest**, good for total ton-miles.

Ideal for carrying large, heavy, or high-density, low value products that are not time sensitive.

Goals:
- Optimizing costs
- Keep locomotives and crews well optimized

Major operational issues at railroad
- Vehicle and staff scheduling
- Track and terminal delays
- Poor on-time performance
### Water
**Ideal for carrying large loads at low cost** but is **supper slow**.
- Movement of large bulk commodity
- The cheapest mode for carrying such loads
- The slowest of all the modes
- Significant delays occur at ports/terminals
- Difficult to operate for short-haul trips
$\implies$ *International trade*, *cheapest*

### Pipelines
For gas/fuel etc. #skip 
### Intermodals
Intermodal transportation is the use of more than one mode of transport to move a shipment to its destination:
- Increased use of containers for shipping and the rise of global trade
- Increasing in use of intermodal transportation
- Containers >> easy to transfer from one mode to another >> facilitate intermodal transportation

#todo add tables from slideS

## Trade offs in transportation design
There are trade offs between #inventory and #transportation costs.
- Apple
- IKEA

Trade-offs between #transportation costs and #customer-responsiveness.
- Build 1 truck every 3 days or 1 truck per day that is 2/3 empty?
- 1st one will give high responsiveness but also high transportation costs
- Other one gives low responsiveness but then low transportation costs

#todo table

## Design Options for a transportation network
A well-designed transportation network gives the **desired degree of responsiveness** at a **low cost**.
### Direct shipment network to single destination
The major advantage is that it *eliminates intermediate warehouses* and thus *simplify operation and coordination*.
- Decision made for one shipment does not influence others
- Optimal replenishment lot sizes are close to a truckload

We will use a heuristic algorithm to determine a good transportation network.
### Direct shipment network with milk runs
A *milk run* is a route on which a truck either delivers product from a single supplier to multiple retailers or goes from multiple suppliers to a single buyer location.
- When using this, a supply chain manager has to decide on **the routing of each milk run**.
#todo 

### All shipments via Intermediate Transit Point with Cross-docking
Complicated to design a good #Cross-docking warehouse but it will **decrease transportation costs** massively.
#todo 
### Shipping via DC using Milk runs
#todo 
7 eleven
### Tailored network
The #tailored-network option is a suitable combination of previous options that reduces the cost and improves the responsiveness of the supply chain.
