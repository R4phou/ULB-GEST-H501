[4_Inventory_Planning-Session SUPCHAINS](4_Inventory_Planning-Session%20SUPCHAINS.pdf)
Session of the 3rd of December. 

PULL system: you produce based on demand
- Issues is that it can be long as the production process can take some time

PUSH system: you produce based on capacity and hope that it sells.
- On a push system, where to store?
	- If close to plant, we can deliver it where we want but slow
	- If close to customer, if other customers orders more than expected, we need to do a back-order (= more transport)

PDCA = Plan Do Check Act
