## 11.1 Basics of strategic supply chain management
There are **5 core disciplines** that are the foundation for Strategic Supply Chain Management.
1. *View your supply chain as a strategic asset*
2. *Develop and E2E process architecture*
3. *Design your organization for performance*
4. *Build the right collaborative model*
5. *Use metrics to drive business success*
$\implies$And these are in a circle.
### Discipline 1 - View your supply chain as a strategic asset
A good supply chain strategy meets **4 basic criteria**:
1. **Aligned with the business strategy**: Each business strategy requires a distinct supply chain structure, processes, systems and skills.
2. **It is aligned with customers need**: Understand each segment's requirements and configure the supply chain appropriately if necessary, create separate/multiple supply chains
3. **It is aligned with the company's power position**: Before making big changes, understand who has the power in the supply chain
4. **It is adaptive**: Supply chains  have a shelf life and should be continuously evaluated to see if change is needed
### Discipline 2 - Develop and E2E process architecture
### Discipline 3 - Design your organization for performance
### Discipline 4 -  Build the right collaborative model

## 11.2 Addressing uncertainties in Strategic Supply Chain Management
#todo sl jusque 61
![[Pasted image 20241214114512.png]]
A new product will have a high supply and demand #uncertainty.
- Then we ramp up and we will remove uncertainties in supplies.
- Then the product gains maturity and it reduces the demand uncertainty.
- At the end of the life of the product, it's supply uncertainty will increase.

So now, the product lifecycles are shorter than ever.

### Demand uncertainty mitigation strategies

### Crossing demand uncertainty mitigation strategy and supply uncertainty
When we cross the **demand uncertainty** and **supply uncertainty**, it gets interesting. We get two additional supply chains type: #Risk-hedging and #Agile![[Pasted image 20241214115755.png]]

A #Risk-hedging supply chain:
- Focus on pooling and sharing resources across the supply chain
- Initiatives: increased safety stocks, multiple suppliers for critical components and real-time sharing of inventory and demand informations

A #Agile supply chain:
- Hybrid of responsive and risk-hedging strategies
- Implement strategies that allow flexibility in response to changing customer needs and pool inventory and other resources to mitigate shortages and supply disruptions.

#todo sl 69/70/71
## 11.4 Focus on AGILE Strategic Supply Chain Management Strategy
Agile supply chain starts with high cost and then the cost will go down over time.

**AGILITY** should be built at every link of the ***Agile Strategic Supply Chain Management Strategy***. Let's see for this the 6+1 rules of thumb:
1. **Quickly provide data on changes** in supply and demand to partners continuously so they can respond quickly.
2. **Develop collaborative relationships** with suppliers and customers so that companies work together to design or redesign processes, components, and products as well as to prepare backup plans.
3. **Introduce postponement:** Design products so that they share common parts and processes initially and differ substantially only by the end of the production process
4. **Keep a small inventory of inexpensive**, nonbulky components that are often the cause of bottlenecks.
5. **Build a dependable logistics system** that can enable your company to regroup quickly in response to unexpected needs
6. **Put together a team that knows how to invoke backup plans**, contingency plans.

And a seventh: *Seek additions that can strenghten the AGILE Strategic SCM Strategy*.

On the demand side: 2 types of products - technological and functional products

There is a need for 2 implementation of supply chains

Low supply variability -> stable process
High supply variability
$\to$ Needs to design a supply chain that can counter both of these

And then there is the crossing between demand and supply variability and it gives us a matrix:![](Pasted%20image%2020241217143535.png)

What is a recomended is to do pooling between companies BUT be careful not to distort the market.

This is the **life** of the product.
## 11.5 Additions to the AGILE Strategic Supply Chain Management Strategy
There are 10 possible additions to make this AGILE strategy better:
1. **Adaptability**: *Meet structural shifts in market*. Modify and adapt strategies/products/technos/
2. **Alignment**: everyone in the chain has the same goal: *deliver the best service to customers*.
3. **Customer-Focused**: 
4. **Global**: deciding to go global = more complexity BUT can be cool.
	If we are global, we must have a lot of **flexibility**
	*Advantages*: competitive sourcing costs, production costs, access to large markets
	*Obstacles*: Politico-economical tensions, pandemics, counterfeiting, can render circularity complex/impossible.
5. **Financial profit-focused**![](Pasted%20image%2020241217151024.png)
6. **Environmentally clean/Green**
	Green supply chain addition refers to *efforts to minimize* the negative impact of supply chains on the natural environment.
	It focus **requires** *working with suppliers* and *customers*. Analysis of internal operations and processes, environmental considerations in the product development process, and extended stewardship across products' life-cycles.
7. **Circularity**
8. **Socially and Ethically responsible**
9. **Lean**
10. **Smart/Digital**

## 11.6 Elaborating a Strategic Supply Chain Management Strategy
### Which Strategic supply chain management strategy is right?
#todo [LEM_Main_session_12_2024-2025](LEM_Main_session_12_2024-2025.pdf#page=36)

### A particular combination  - Triple A
**Top performing** Supply chain process 3 very different qualities that are **essentials**:
- **Agile**: react speedily to sudden change in demand or supply
- **Adaptable**: because over time as market structures and strategies evolve
	Compare to agile, here it is the market structures that evolves. Not the market itself.
- **Aligned**: The interests of all participants in the supply chain are aligned.
![](Pasted%20image%2020241217160357.png)
### Necessary holistic approach to supply chain management
Leading companies manage **adpatatively** their supply chain by focusing on 2 important dimensions:
- First they **holistically** define the scope: *supply chains as interactive systems*, *not* as functional *silos*.
- Second, they are **proactive**: continuously *achieve improvements* through a focus on preventing fires, not on fighting them.![](Pasted%20image%2020241217161004.png)

### Necessary trade-offs paradigms
Therefore we need to discuss the different trade-offs:
![](Pasted%20image%2020241217161342.png)
![](Pasted%20image%2020241217162948.png)

The actual market competition is very aggressive and supply chains must be designed to be robust. The challenge in today’s business environment, where organizations need to answer to the market volatility, is to combine additions and to integrate them in their supply chain strategy.

**Building the right supply chain strategy** – one that can ensure quick response to evolving market and supply conditions, and that functions well during both a short-term disruption and a years-long crisis, is a business challenge.

The understanding of major trade-offs between additions in a holistic perspective **contributes to a more efficient and competitive supply chain strategy**.

$\implies$ **PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT SCIENCE** offers a suitable framework for making these trade-offs possible through the assessment of supply chain management strategies.
