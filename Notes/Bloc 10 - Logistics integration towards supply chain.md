## 10.1 Integration principles
The challenge of **optimisation**:
- **Optimise bloc per bloc** leads to a high risk of accrual of local fluctuations and uncertainties: ► Bullwhip effect
	- If you have 11 Lamine Yamal you don't have the best team!
- **Optimise all blocs together** raises some conceptual and mathematical complexities theoretically tractable but practically disconnected from reality.
- **Optimise bloc per bloc or all blocs together** raises the question of local versus overall performance.

Therefore the approach **must target** **system as a whole** and considers trade-offs.

The objectives of #integration-towards-supply-chain:
- Conception and pilotage of an **integrated an coordinated system** (of materials/information/processes/functions and resources) where the priority is given to the overall optimal performance and not to the local optima.
	- An OVERALL OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE IS NOT THE ADDITION OF LOCAL OPTIMA.
	- LOCAL OPTIMISATION APPROACHES LEAD TO THE « BULLWHIP EFFECT 
$\to$ Accrual of local fluctuations that leads to a final high uncertainty.

#todo supply chain "thinking"
#todo supply chain Management

The **final target of a supply chain** must be an **efficient consumer response**, meaning that we need to provide:
1. Right Client
2. The Right Product 
3. In the Right Quantity 
4. At the Right Place 
5. At the Right Time 
6. At the Right Conditions 
7. At the Right Price
8. With the Right Overall Carbon Fooprint!

Therefore, these companies that do well commonly report:
- Lower inventory, transportation, warehousing and packaging *costs*
- Greater supply chain flexibility
- Improved customer services
- Higher revenues
- Increased profitability

Of course the supply chain is important as it is where the money is.
### SCOR - Reference model
There is a model that is important #SCOR: a reference model, a cross-industry open standard:![[Pasted image 20241214093506.png]]
It is based on 4 big parsts:
- Performance
- Processes
- Practices
- People

#### Process
In this we do **process mapping**: #SCOR is a *process reference model*. The purpose of a process reference model, is to **define process architecture in a way that aligns with key business functions and goals**.
- The idea is to transform an #As-Is model into a #To-Be models.

Each process can be decomposed in subprocesses: here we have an example with the #sourcing:![[Pasted image 20241214093742.png]]

And here a generalization of this decomposition in levels method:![[Pasted image 20241214093845.png]]

#### Practices
Not supper interesting #skip.

#### Performance
#performance is the most important bloc of the #SCOR methodology.![[Pasted image 20241214094242.png]]
## 10.2 Measure of Integration: Maturity levels
Really hard to define #integration. But we can easily agree on what is good or what is bad. 
	Lower and upper threshold that we will try to move (if everyone agrees) to find what is the integration.

There are 4 levels of #maturity corresponding to 4 stages of supply chain #integration:
### Stage 1: Functional
Clustered, vertical functions and activities (Supply, Productionb, Sales) and the the only target parameter is the **product cost**.
$\implies$ It is the #Silo-approach, there is no integration
![[Pasted image 20241214095533.png]]
### Stage 2: Integrated company
The next step is that the supply manages the inventory. It is still clustered but some functions are grouped and managed per groups.

The target parameters are now: **product cost** and **product quality**.![[Pasted image 20241214095542.png]]
### Stage 3: Extended company
This step adds *cooperation with suppliers and distributors*. Wherever we are, we have information on the different blocks etc.

The target parameters are now: **cost, quality** and **respect of promises made to the client**.![[Pasted image 20241214095639.png]]
### Stage 4: Client Oriented Network Company
This step consists in building a *cooperative approach* with an *external integration from the supplier to the final client/customer*. By using cookies (for google etc).

The target parameters consists in **building a strong competitive advantage**.
Ex: Apple, Windows,...

### Summary
Integration was not needed for cement, steel etc as they were not interested in quality as they were the monopoles. It was really a #push system.

Traveling from maturity level 1 to 4 is facilitated by **communication**. #bonus

**Four intertwined layers of integration** can be established including: 
1. Integration of flows (physical, information and financial); 
2. Integration of processes and activities; 
3. Integration of technologies and systems;
4. Integration of actors (structure and organisations).

**The scope of integration:** nature and number of stakeholders included may vary: 
- *Limited dyadic downstream:* Integration between the company and its customers.
- *Limited dyadic upstream* Integration between the company and its suppliers.
- *Limited dyadic*. Integration between the company and separately, downstream with customers upstream with suppliers. 
- *Limited triadic.* Integration of suppliers, focal company and customers (without differentiating upstream and downstream).
- *Extended*. Integration between $\geq$ 3 parties along the chain: customers’ customers, suppliers’ suppliers or other stakeholders
## 10.3 Audit of Supply Chain Integration
Auditing a company's supply chain integration means, looking where it is on the scale and where it can go if we maximise/optimize it. What is the potential of this company's supply chain integration.

The objectives of #audit:
- Assess the performances of the company's functions
- **Determine the levels of maturity** **of the company’s** supply chain
- Highlight the **potential for progress** (Progress zones) 
- Determine the **decisions/plans to be put into place** in order **to reach a higher integrated** level (move to the progress zone)

### Determination of the level of a supply chain intergration
There are 6 key audit fields for the determination of the SC #maturity levels.

Each of the 6 fields is divided into attributes:![[Pasted image 20241214101613.png]]

Then each of these attributes are evaluated with respect to the level of integration:![[Pasted image 20241214101644.png]]

Then we consolidate (aggregation) of the above evaluations to help highlighting for each field the actual level of maturity. They are used to
- Highlight the gaps with the highest or targeted maturity level;
- Initiate the search of plans and measures to lift up integration
- Benchmark with other companies’ values and often the « best-in-class » company.
