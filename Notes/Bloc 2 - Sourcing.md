## 1. Introduction
#Source concerns:
- Input materials (supply, purchase)
- Input flows (continuous, on demand)
- Storage of input materials
- Timing of arrivals of input materials
- **Variability** of the input materials **cost**
- **Quality** of input materials: you cannot test all the materials you receive
- *Unexpected event or change*: climate change/flooding etc
- Etc.

The key #challenges of #sourcing:
- Identification and selection of the #suppliers
- **Quality control**: control the quality of the materials
- Integration of suppliers constraints
- Collaboration with the suppliers
- Partnership with suppliers
- International risks (political, legal, etc)

**Purchase & Supplies are needed to acquire the necessary inputs in order to manufacture finished products or provide services**.

The function of **Supply & Purchasing** has a great impact on the level of competitiveness of a company.
- This function is of a changing nature and it is becoming a strategic issue for the companies.
- Studies tend to show that **at least 50% of the companies’ income statements is attributable to that function** ! (any gain on it is therefore important!)

#Purchasing: once quantities (and types) of inputs required and date of availability are known; it is about **selecting the appropriate suppliers** (specification)

#Supply: Once everything is set; it is about: **purchase order to suppliers**, **order tracking**, **receipt of order & quality control** and **transfer to the warehouse**.

$\to$ The fluctuating nature of the economic environment proves the necessity to have flexible suppliers and products with an adequate quality at the right time.

**Importance of purchasing**:

## 2. Mission and Operational objectives
There are **7** key points for #sourcing:
1. Find and acquire the **necessary inputs** according to clear and precise specification
2. **Target an objective quality level** from the #suppliers 
3. **Flexibility of the supplier** needs to be ensured (response to short delays, unforeseen variability etc)
4. Guarantee the **level of services expected** by internal customers
5. Ensure full **control of** related upstream **risks**
6. Design & control company's **supply and purchasing policy**
7. Contribute to the **innovation** policy of the company through a good knowledge of upstream (suppliers) innovation
## 3. The sourcing portfolio
*All goods, services and facilities purchased by the company and clustered according to a given logic*:
1. Purchase of direct (input) production materials (raw materials)
2. Purchase of outsourced services/products
3. Purchaqe of transport and logistic services
4. Purchase of technical and R&D services
5. Purchase of energy
6. Purchase of investments
7. Purchase of overheads

 **These clusters often cope with the tasks’ distribution observed within the Company’s Purchasing Department**.
## 4. Purchasing strategy
Now that everything is there, we did not select yet the supplier so we need to select it.

There are **four major steps** for the #Purchasing strategy:
1. #clustering of the purchasing #portfolio into *homogeneous* #segments
2. On each #segments, identify
	- The economical stakes
	- The various associated **risks**
	- The priority and specific leverages
3. For each segment, definition of an **operational action plan**
	Define a strategy to how I will deal with the supplier
4. Finally, definition of a **performance measurement system** for each segment and for all the segments
### Second step details:  Analysis
Analyse according **three axes**
1. Economic stakes: annual values of purchase
2. Risks associated to the suppliers and suppliers market
3. Risks associated to product features & technicity, and products internal risks, recurrence of purchase, etc…

## 5. Sourcing and elaboration of the suppliers panel

Here, the **identification of the suppliers that can meet the needs of the company in terms of** #cost, #time, #innovation and #quality is seen.

It is again divided in 4 major steps:
1. *Market, Risk and change analysis*
	What is the flexibility, what is the practice of the suppliers in terms of
	- Technological foresight
	- Benchmarking
	- Market trends
	- Products trends/evolution
	- Risks analysis
2. *Assessment and approval of suppliers*
	Will the supplier agree and believe in our project, what is their
	- Competence and quality management system
	- Competence and R&D innovation capacity
	- Industrial competence
	- Flexibility, logistics organization
	- Reactivity / Additional services provided
	- Level of competitiveness
	- Compliance with sustainable development's requirement
	- Competence in terms of management skills
	- Terms/Conditions of delivery
	- Total cost of acquisition #TCA / economic conditions
3. *Selection of the suppliers panel (use multi-criteria analysis)* #MCDA
	![](Pasted%20image%2020241119145611.png)
4. *Management (tightening) of the Suppliers Panel*
	 - The **panel should not be frozen**
	 - Definition of a set of indicators to **monitor suppliers performance**
	 - Creation of **subsets/pool** of suppliers **especially for riskier purchases**
	 - **Tighten** progressively the suppliers **panel** in order to avoid scattering of purchases throughout many sources.
	 - **Pay** particular **attention to new suppliers** (newcomers)
	 - Set a **total quality management plan** with each supplier (win-win)
	 - Manage **ruthlessly** the **elimination of bad suppliers** if ever the recovery plans fail
	 No mercy for the bad suppliers, if the second chance fails, you're out.![](Pasted%20image%2020241119150159.png)

#todo done in 4? to check
## 6. Company-suppliers relationships
A very good management of #company-suppliers relationships is **critical**:
- Makes more effective business links between a company and its suppliers
- Contributes to the **decrease of production costs**
- Contributes to the **increase of the quality of raw materials** supplied
- Increases the **quality of services from suppliers** (responsiveness, …)

There are **3 usual types of relationships** #company-suppliers:
1. #Traditional (oriented cost optimization): the goal is to increase profits through the **control of costs** of purchases.
	Formal systems of evaluation and certification
	Open contracts (invitation to "deliver" rather than call for tenders)
	Reliable forecasts of supply needs
	$\implies$ The normal way
2. #Collaborative relationships: *oriented towards operational optimisation*
	 - **It is not only the cost/price of purchases that matters**
	 - Quality and high level of services required
	 - Real-Time Exchange of operational information between the company and the supplier: *Send order request automatically when stock is low for a product for example*
	 - Multi-annual plans (horizon)
	 -  Overlapping of logistics etc #todo 
3. #Partnership: *oriented towards true performance*
	- To cope with **new business challenges**: customization, rapid changes, short time-to-market, ability to innovate quickly, etc.
	- Suitable in the case of high level of risk or fast-changing technologies (IT, aeronautics, defense, electronic business, etc).
	$\to$ Supplier is given a direct contribution in the design and evolution of the products
	$\to$ Long-term relationship, reciprocal commitments, mutual respect and transparency in information exchange
	$\to$ A technical co-contracting of final products/processes by joint R&D

Focus on the #Partnership where we use a specific set of tools: #SRM **Supplier Relationship Management**:
- SRM is a set of tools to increase exchange of information between a company and its suppliers.
- When the relationships is mature and based on solid trust, there is a possibility to:
	- Standardize the data exchange systems $\to$ Better results
	- Integrate supply chain activities/processes. For instance, the implementation of a CPR tool (Collaborative Planning Replenishment) - *Def:* "'A specific tool that retailers, distributors, manufacturers and suppliers can use to collaborate on operational planning, forecasting, supply and replenishment."*End Def*.
## 7. Conclusion
The **suppliers play a fundamental role** in the logistics operation ecosystem, it is super important to:
- **Pay attention to the identification/selection** of the #suppliers 
- **Enhance** the **collaboration** with the **critical** #suppliers by building gradually a partnership which can be extended to planning (for instance a #CPR - **Collaborative Planning & Replenishment**).
