## 12.1 Assessing the performance of Supply Chain Management Strategies
### Recalling the fifth core discipline of Strategic Supply Chain Management
![](Pasted%20image%2020241217164537.png)
As explained here, there is the **need to have a good metric** to **measure** the *health of each core supply chain process* and *identify the problem areas*.![](Pasted%20image%2020241217164623.png)
### Performance management science as an assessment framework
**Performance management** is a **continuous process** (not a one-shot) that identifies opportunities for bringing improvements that can lead to **industrial and business excellence** through the **continuous analysis of measures** such as standard indicators.

#Performance-management is built around 4 pillars that are each containing specific approaches tools and technologies to:
1. **Select key indicators** and **best standards** for business
2. **Gather relevant information**
3. **Quantify and measure them**
4. **Report, benchmark and monitor them**
#### Pillar 1: Key Indicators and Best Standard Values Selection
Indicators should provide a holistic perspective of #quality, *service*, #productivity, *profitability* and *competitiveness*.

***Example of indicators:*** picking accuracy, shipment accuracy, proper labeling, lead time, lost sales, fill rates, throughput, asset turns, inventory turns, days on hand, revenue, return on investment, distribution excellence, operational excellence, output, staff productivity, customer satisfaction, cost of inventory, etc.

The **key characteristics of an indicator**:
- Congruent with the mission, vision, strategic goals 
- Focus on accomplishable activities that lead towards a better performance. 
- Accessible and easy to understand (complex indicators do not necessarily translate into effective results).
- Convey relevant information for decision making and strategic planning. 
- Allow comparison against competitors.
- Best standards relate to best industry standards or benchmarks
$\to$ **Pertinence** - related to the objective, the targeted item
$\to$ **Quantifiable** - from the available information/data
$\to$ **Perennity** - in time
$\to$ **Sensibility** - to cope with the level of detail defined
$\to$ **Unbiased** - no possibility of multiple interpretations

We can then **classify** the **indicators** in **five dimensions**:![](Pasted%20image%2020241217170125.png)
#todo [LEM_Main_session_12_2024-2025](LEM_Main_session_12_2024-2025.pdf#page=56)

In conclusion, we have **many metrics** but **not all of them should be indicators**. These should be **unbiased**. And then we can **cascade/aggregate it** with other indicators to form the #KPI.
#### Pillar 2: Data collection and Data cleaning
- Manual, semi-automatized or fully automatized data collection.
- Use of advanced IT tools and programs 
- Cleaning to isolate wrong records and inconsistent data
#todo 
#### Pillar 3: Performance measurement

#### Pillar 4: Performance reporting and monitoring
- Reporting and displaying the **key indicators** values using #BI (Business intelligence) tools
- Continuously **benchmarking and monitoring** these values to allow tracking the attainment of corporate goals.

### Conclusion
#performance #Performance-management
![](Pasted%20image%2020241217170928.png)

It is important to track the performance and look at **what to correct**. It is important **not to look for someone to blame**. **Measuring** should always be to **measure** #progress!
## 12.2 Building a supply chain performance management model
Now that we have seen the 4 pillars, let's look at how we can **implement them**.

The goals of building a *supply chain performance management model* are:
- Assess the performances of the company's supply chain strategies
- Determine the appropriateness of the company's supply chain strategies
- Highlight the potential for performance improvement, for progress.
- Determine the decisions/plans to be deployed in order to reach a higher level of performance.

There is a **need to consider the increasing power and scope of analytics**:![](Pasted%20image%2020241217172554.png)Depending on the *competitive advantage* and the *sophistication of intelligence*, the analysis needed is not the same! As described in the table above.

#predictive-analytics allows to keep the lead, it is important especially to understand *why is this happening*.

Define **new metrics and performance system** #High-5s
1. A new *driver-based metrics* framework that seriously considers the *right cross-functional accountabilities and trade-offs.*
2. *Stable data* with few unexplainable swings
3. Capable of *drill-down analysis* to search for root causes and to anticipate future (simulation)
4. *Easily accessible to and accepted* by relevant parties
5. Supported by a *disciplined and documented governance process* 

It should always be clear on to who belongs the data that is used (customers,...?) and how the data is being governed.
