## 9.1 Introduction of the concept of Quality
#quality determines the success of a business.
- #quality-principles and **rules** have a strong impact on **performance**
- But there are difficulties in implementing the principle of quality.
$\implies$ #quality is not a **matter** of good or bad will of people, but it results from a good or bad **management**
### Reasons behind the deterioration of quality
When #quality is **deteriorated** it may be because of: #deterioration
- **Ambiguity of product specifications** and working rules. Each actor has its own *interpretation*
- **Machines** may often be *out of order*
- **Work stations poorly lit** or badly organized
- **Work stations in disarray**, cluttered aisles, mixed bins/trays
- Everyone tries to produce as fast as possible
- In case of accident, enhanced control after the event
- No preventive measures regarding the origin of the defect
- Purchasers continue to **prefer cheaper suppliers**
- **Lack of communication** between services and everyone blames the other
$\implies$ There is a need to **set up** #formalize in the company, a sound and continuous **improvement plan**.
### Quality issues from the customers perspective
The understanding of #quality for the #customer:
- What is better between Rolls Royce or a Toyota?
	$\implies$ *Depends on the need of the customer*
So the **customer satisfaction makes the quality of the product**. The quality is not related to the intrinsic value of the product but to the expectation of the customer.
$\implies$ It is the customer that defines the quality of the product!

The quality must always be defined by a **client-product** relation:
	*The quality of a product or service is its ability to meet the needs of the users/clients*.
### Quality issues from the companies perspective
Artisan or shopkeeper **receives immediate appreciation** from the customers and *adjusts its offer.*

$\implies$It is **not the case of an industrial organization**: the *product nature* and the *number of people involved* in the production *do not allow a direct, permanent contac*t with the *customer*.

In this case, #quality is a complex process defined by a two steps mechanism:
1. Specification of needs (simulates “contact” with the customer) 
2. Production in accordance with the specifications
![[Pasted image 20241123100523.png]]
### Quality loop
The #quality-loop is as follow but contains **three major difficulties** to achieve this simple definition. #important (client should be market on the image).![[Pasted image 20241123100651.png]]
The #marketing step is the **first potential gap** as if there is a difference between *potential needs* and *expressed needs*.

The #design step is the **second potential gap** as if the *expressed needs* is different from the *specified pattern*. 

The #manufacturing may lead to a **third potential gap** as the *manufactured product* and the *specified pattern* may differ.

The #usage step may lead to a **fourth potential gap** as the *satisfied needs* and the *product sold* may differ.

The #repurchase step also might be a **gap**.

In the end we want to **reduce the five gaps** to **limit the risks of impacting the** #quality.
$\implies$ The smallest the gap, the more we reach the satisfaction of clients/produce.

Note that it is also possible that by the time we reach the last step, the *potential needs might change*! Therefore there is a need for **continuous improvement**. 
#### Difficulty 1: Number of players in the process
There are numerous entities and persons involved in the process. And this leads to a **high probability of occurrence of errors**.

The #productivity is the *sum of the efforts provided by the different actors* involved in the production process.

A #no-quality **at a point** **in** the production **process** **cannot be compensated** by an #over-quality made **elsewhere** in the process. 

$\implies$ #quality is a **disjunctive characteristic**
#### Difficulty 2: Combinatorial
A complex product leads to opportunities for **defect increase**.
- a simple car with 10,000 components.
- If for each component the probability of default is 1/10 000, the proportion of finished vehicles without any default will be only 1/3 !!! (0.9999 power 10 000, say 36%)

There is only one principle that should apply: *Zero default/defect*.
#### Difficulty 3: Induced cost
Who is willing to pay a (promised) default-less car five times more expensive than the normal market price?

Ensuring a product quality is important **but not at the expense of very hig induced costs** (inspections, controls, reworks/changes, etc).

#quality sets a real **company culture** with *values and principles*.
### Tentative definition of the concept of quality
#Quality:
* **Is not a matter of good/bad will** of people but it **results from a good/bad management**
* **Sets** a real **company culture** with values & principles.
* Must always **be defined by a client-product relation**
$\implies$ The #quality of a product/service is its **ability to meet the** #needs **of the customers** (users/clients).
## 9.2 The five fundamental principles of quality management
### Principle 1: Meet customers expectation
Based on the **compliance with the customers needs and expectations**:
- Must be applied to *all levels of the company* (not only one level!)
- All services must be adequately informed 
- “Quality” in the way of doing is necessary between these internal services who should behave like "clients-suppliers“ do. 
- “Over”-Quality must not occur !
### Principle 2: Zero defect/failure/fault
There is **only one acceptable standard** "target”: **zero defect**! No target such as "close to 100%”.

Expression in percentage may be dangerous : 99.99% success rate means: 
- At least one flight would crash per day at some airports
- Tens of thousands of false medical prescriptions per day 
- Tens of thousands of erroneous banking operations pd
- Hundreds of errors at ATMs per day
- Etc.
### Principle 3: Preventive approach
There is only one viable method: a preventive approach. *“It is better safe than sorry“*.
 - Avoiding to generate defects because this involves repair or scrapping costs.
 - *Investigate systematically* the causes of the phenomena and treat them rather than addressing the effects.
 - **Anticipate upstream the operations**’ chain and *“drive” your suppliers* to adopt the same approach.
### Principle 4: Objective monitoring method QM, with clear/pertinent rules
We need to meet **two** **essential conditions**:
1. Have an *objective measurement system* with clear and indisputable indicators.
2. *Formalize rules and methods* for: 
	- Internal and external communication 
	- Training of employees (on these QM management tools)
	- Ensuring their reproducibility at all stakeholders levels
### Principle 5: Continuous/Permanent progress
Establish **an effective system for continuous improvemen**t:
- Business is not (can not be) a juxtaposition of specialists, performers and operators 
- Managers and leaders are becoming “MCs”
- Think first to eliminate the causes of the problems rather than their effects. The effective resolution of the problems should involve the operators.
- *Operators have extended responsibilities*
#Quality is linked to a *long and continuous process of learning and progress*.
## 9.3 Total quality management methods based on the Kaizen approach
#Kaizen is a concept of **continuous improvement**:
- Everyone must continuously make improvements on his work/workplace

Japanese companies attach a lot of importance to #Kaizen and they find that:
- *Despite the quality of equipment and methods, there is potential for progress that is expressed only during the implementation phase.*
- The **person the better placed** to suggest **improvements** is the *one who uses* the device *daily*.
- TOYOTA leaders estimated that productivity gains are 50% from Kaizen methods and 50% from new investments ( a point of view which is shared nowadays by the Western industrials !)

FUKUDA study on several plants of the Japanese Sumitomo Group (rubber) showed that *increasing productivity gains from 20 to 25% can be achieved*:
- Either by an investment of about $ 7,000 / person / year
- or by increasing the number of suggestions from 3.5 to 5.5 per pers/year
$\implies$ One suggestion per person per year is equivalent to an investment of ± 3500$!![[Pasted image 20241123111742.png]]

Masaaki Imai study showed that #performance increase always involves **two components**:
- Structural modification in technology or organisation (innovation)
- All (non struct) improvements made continuously by the workers (Kaizen)
![[Pasted image 20241123111903.png]]
In the absence of Kaizen, performance degrades after each tech or org change. As #Kaizen allows to increase performance continuously between two major “jumps”.
### Simple suggestion systems
![[Pasted image 20241123111951.png]]
The #suggestion-box relates to ideas that allows to **increase revenue**.

#Kaizen focuses on the **many ideas that provide each a bit of improvement bu in total represent a significant amount**.
![[Pasted image 20241123112118.png]]

But there are **conditions for success**:
- All ideas are interesting, because even if they cannot be implemented, they reflect a problem to be solved.
- The proposals are discussed in Team: adherence and improved formulation 
- The proposals are shown and visible by all
- Supervision and Support Services provide a help
- The realization is fast: powerful motivation for employees.

These simple suggestion systems/methods are integrated into a broader set:
- #problem-solving-groups following a systematic approach to solve a given problem and made in consultation with management
- #CEDAC  (Cause & Effect Diagram with the Addition of Cards)
- #Hoshin-Method mobilize the entire team for a short time to reorganize the work tool
- #Ishikawa-Fishbone-Diagram
### CEDAC method
#CEDAC **CAUSE & EFFECT DIAGRAM WITH THE ADDITION OF CARDS**
#todo sl31 32
### Problem-Solving groups
Developed by the Japanese for the Quality Forums/Circles who needed structured methods to help them in their approach to solving quality problems. 

Currently **widely used** by all industrial groups
![[Pasted image 20241123112339.png]]
### Ishikawa "Fishbone" Diagrams
Divided in steps:
1. Record all defects observed whenever non quality occurs
2. Pareto analysis on the previous data recorded
3. The 5 main branches of the #Ishikawa-Fishbone-Diagram 
4. Elaborate the #fishbone (cause-effects) diagram
5. Analyse the #fishbone (cause-effects) diagram

Its **effectiveness stems from two elements**: 
- Helps decompose a complex problem 
- Helps to avoid forgetting some important causes
$\implies$ It’s a powerful tool.

1. **Record all defects observed whenever non quality occurs**![[Pasted image 20241123112539.png]]
2. **Pareto analysis on the previous data recorded**
	- **Classify defects** in nature on the basis of their relative importance
	- **Find out the critical ones** from experience, a small number of defects represents the greater percentage of non-quality occurrence
	- **These critical defects must be addressed in priority** (here number 4)![[Pasted image 20241123112747.png]]
3. **The 5 main branches of the** #Ishikawa-Fishbone-Diagram 
	- The *causes/origins of a DEFECT* are to be **sought in the five categories, (“5”M)**: #5M-process
		Materials, Man power, Machine, Methods, Milieu (environment of work)![[Pasted image 20241123112905.png]]
4. **Elaborate the #fishbone (cause-effects) diagram**
	- Elaborate the backbone of the diagram with the defect and the 5 branches.
	- For each branch, seek the causes → the causes of the causes to the root cause
	![[Pasted image 20241123113024.png]]
5. **Analyse the #fishbone (cause-effects) diagram**
	- Analyse for each branch, the “tree” of causes and classify them
	- Focus primarily on the most important.
	Ishikawa diagram *classifies the possible causes of failure according to their origin*
### 5S
#5S illustrates the principles of Kaizen, was developed in Japan, late 1980 and applies to offices, shops, stores. It mobilize all employees to improve the cleanliness and “spirit” of the working environment/place.

The #5S process is:
- SEIRI (remove all that does not belong or is not necessary to the working place)
- SEITON (sort/put in order) 
- SEISO (keep it clean)
- SEIKETSU (standardize, visualize, good practices)
- SHITSUKE (respect rules)

#5S is **an extremely efficient and cost effective process**.

Best choice to promote organizational learning 
- Work in groups, develop a common language, organize, plan, solve problems, communicate, etc.

Implementation of a "5S" project in a medium company **takes about 2 years**: strong commitment and investment in time are critical

It helps to introduce gradually a “new culture of quality and performance” favourable to the successful realisation of Just-in-Time and Total Quality plans, or the successful introduction of new technologies.

Many companies see it as "a base camp” for the conquest of other success peaks.
## 9.4 Other total quality management methods
### 6 Sigma
Developed by Motorola in the 1980s as a **way to reach "zero defect/default”**, it is widely used nowadays.

The **goal** is to reduce the risk of defects to a few parts per million (ppm)
	e.g. percentage of non-compliant products is less than what a normal probability distribution leaves beyond six standard deviations.

To say that a **process** is #6-sigma means that there is a probability of defects less than 3.4 DPMO:
	e.g. the probability of occurrence of a defect is less than 3.4 x10-6 or 0.0000034

To say that a process is "3 sigma" mean: 
- 20,000 letters lost per hour, 
- 5000 failed surgeries per week, etc.

#6-sigma is a very powerful, demanding method for **continuous improvement**.![[Pasted image 20241123114610.png]]

The normal distribution law gives theoretically a value of 2,7 DPMO at 6$\sigma$. A correction factor (shift) of 1.5$\sigma$, is applied in order to obtain 3.4 DPMO.
