#Theorical
Logistics operations are important in everyday's life:
- Supply of shops
- Supply of manufacturing companies
- Emergency operations
- Defense operations
- ...

#Logistic is really general and diverse but it has the following in common:
- *The management of the oprations involving flows of goods, materials, ...*

The big 4 #Logitics **steps**:
1. **Supply** of raw input material
2. Processing (**Production** operations)
3. Physical **distribution** of the finished goods to the customer
4. Reverse/**Return** operations

A **chain** of **interrelated operations tightly linked to the other company functions**.

## History
20th century - #Taylor
- Works for mass production
- Increase productivity by assigning unskilled tasks to unskilled people
- Lack of motivation

1913 - #Ford: assembly lines and standardization
- to cope with growing demand
- Invention of the concept of assembly line
- To reduce production costs, Ford establishes the concept of #standartisation
	- Creating standardized screws etc, no differentiation etc.
- System of **mass production**
	- Privileges *quantity over quality*
	- Does not cope with the diversification of industrial products

1913-1924 - Harris and Wilson: #EOQ Economic order quantity

1916 - #Fayol - Principles of management

Early 1980 - #JIT concept - Just In Time
- Produce what you need just at the right time (**from PUSH to PULL** logistics)
- Reduce stocks and response times throughout the logistics process
- Production equals  to customer demand $\to$ zero inventory
- **Key conditions** are:
	- Zero *delay* (absolute respect of production plans)
	- Zero *defects* (total quantity)
	- Zero *failure* (preventive maintenance)
	- Zero *paper* (Reduction of administrative procedures and unnecessary tasks)
	- Redefine *relationships with suppliers* (collaboration, partnership, risk sharing)

1990-2000 - The **Total Productivity** concept
- Over the years, companies have accumulated a huge range of services and functions. These must be reduced and unproductive functions/services cut.
- **Lean production**: *mobilize only the necessary resources* and *avoid waste*, *duplication of operations*, etc.
- **Business Process Reingeneering** #BPR
	- Restructure the processes from the customer perspective
	- Look for gains at the interface of the operations
## Components

### PLAN
The #PLAN block concerns:
- Market demand
- Quantities of finished goods
- Input materials
- Human resources
- Manufacturing equipment
- Distribution systems
- Delivery operations

The Key challenges are
- The **variability** of the *market demand* and new trends
- The **variability** of the *costs of input materials*
- Unexpected events

This phase is **VERY IMPORTANT**.

### SOURCE
- Input materials (supply, purchase)
- Input flows (continuous, on demand)
- Storage of input materials
- Timing of arrivals of input materials
- Variability of input materials cost
- Quality of input materials
- Unexpected events or challenged (Suez canal blocked,...)

The key challenges:
- Identification and **selection of the suppliers**
- **Quality control**
- Integration of **suppliers constraints**
- **Collaboration** with the suppliers

### MAKE
- Types of finished goods
- Manufacturing plans/processes
- Manufacturing equipment
- Manufacturing rhythm (continuous; on demand)
- Arrivals of input materials
- Storage of finished goods
- Quality of finished goods
- Unexpected event or breakdown

The key challenges:
- Optimal manufacturing plan
- Availability of input materials
- Reliability of the equipment
- Reliability of the resources
- TODO

### WAREHOUSE AND DELIVER
- Type/function of warehouses
- Storage of finished/semi-finished goods
- Packaging/Cross-docking
- Handling of finished good
- **Order's management**
- Selection of transport means
- *Delivery to customers*
-  **Customer support services**
- Etc
TODO
### RETURN/REVERSE LOGISTICS
- TODO

Critical aspect due to growing concerns about climate change, exhaust of natural resources and environmental protection.

It creates a value creating business avenue.

### Logistics operations face critical challenges
#challenges
- Globalisation of production/trade
- Fierce global competitions
- Tough quality requirements
- Fast changing (and volatile) consumer habits
- Ever increasingly variety of demanded goods
- Fast changing IT/Tech (digitalisation, robotisation, etc)
- Shortened times-to-market and product lifecycles
- New social, ethical and environmental constraints

The **final target** of the management of logistics operations must be:

**Provide to the**
1. **Right client**
2. **The right product**
3. **In the right quantity**
4. **At the right place**
5. **At the right time**
6. **At the right conditions**
7. **At the right price**
8. **With the right carbon footprint**
